## Who Am I?
I am a recent MS Graduate from Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus in Embedded Systems.
I like working on projects related to Embedded Systems, especially those that have user-focused features. 
My wide range of interests is showcased through the projects.
